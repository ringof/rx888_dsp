# rx888_dsp Architecture

## Overview

`rx888_dsp` is a fixed-function, real-time DSP decimation pipeline designed to
process very high sample-rate SDR data on commodity x86-64 CPUs. The design
prioritizes deterministic performance, low memory traffic, and clean
integration into Unix pipelines.

The codebase intentionally trades generality for predictability and
measurability.

## Functional Goal

Input:
- 135 MS/s real-valued int16 samples (RX888-class front ends)

Output:
- 33.75 MS/s complex float32 IQ (interleaved I/Q)

Net effect:
- Real → complex conversion
- Two-stage decimation by 2 (overall ÷4)
- Frequency translation to complex baseband

## Conceptual DSP Pipeline

Conceptually, the signal processing consists of four stages:

1. **Stage 1**  
   Convert int16 input samples to float and apply a −Fs/4 frequency shift
   (real → complex).

2. **Stage 2**  
   19-tap halfband FIR filter with decimation-by-2.

3. **Stage 3**  
   Apply a +Fs/4 frequency shift to re-center the spectrum.

4. **Stage 4**  
   235-tap halfband FIR filter (folded) with decimation-by-2.

## Stage Fusion Strategy

For performance reasons, the conceptual stages are *not* implemented as four
separate passes.

### Stage 1 + Stage 2 Fusion

Stage 1 is fused into Stage 2 by performing the int16→float conversion and
−Fs/4 frequency shift directly while filling the Stage 2 extended FIR window.
This eliminates:
- One full buffer write
- One full buffer read
- An extra traversal of the data

### Stage 3 + Stage 4 Fusion

Stage 3 is fused into Stage 4 by applying the +Fs/4 frequency shift while
filling the Stage 4 extended FIR window. This avoids an additional standalone
frequency-shift pass and improves cache locality.

The resulting execution order is:

```
(Stage 1 + Stage 2) → (Stage 3 + Stage 4)
```

## FIR and Halfband Design

### Halfband Filters

Both decimation stages use halfband FIR filters:

- Stage 2: 19 taps
- Stage 4: 235 taps

Halfband filters have every other coefficient equal to zero, allowing
**folding** of symmetric coefficient pairs. This reduces the effective number
of multiplications:

- Stage 2: 6 MACs per output sample
- Stage 4: 59 MAC pairs + center tap per output sample

This reduction is essential to achieving real-time performance at 135 MS/s.

---

## SIMD Strategy

The DSP pipeline is vectorized using AVX2 and FMA:

- Structure-of-Arrays (SoA) layout for I and Q data
- AVX2 vectors process 8 float samples at a time
- FMA instructions used in FIR inner loops
- Explicit handling of AVX2 lane semantics using `permute2f128` where required

Scalar fallback code exists only for reference; the program requires AVX2.

---

## Threading Model

The application uses three threads:

1. **Input Thread (main thread)**  
   - Reads from stdin
   - Fills buffers from a fixed pool
   - Pushes filled buffers to the processing queue

2. **Processing Thread**  
   - Executes the fused DSP pipeline
   - Pushes completed buffers to the output queue

3. **Output Thread**  
   - Writes IQ data to stdout or a FIFO
   - Handles downstream disconnect/reconnect gracefully

Threads communicate using lock-free single-producer/single-consumer queues
implemented with C11 atomics.

---

## Buffering and Memory Management

- Fixed-size buffer pool allocated at startup
- No dynamic allocation on the hot path
- Explicit control of backpressure vs. drop behavior
- Memory alignment chosen to support efficient SIMD loads/stores

This ensures predictable latency and avoids allocator-induced jitter.

---

## Error Handling and Robustness

- Fail-fast behavior for invalid usage or unsupported CPUs
- Short reads and broken pipes handled explicitly
- SIGPIPE ignored; reconnect logic handled in output thread
- Optional SIGUSR1 statistics reporting for live inspection

---

## Design Constraints and Non-Goals

This architecture intentionally does **not** support:

- Multiple concurrent pipelines
- Runtime reconfiguration of DSP stages
- Non-x86 platforms
- GPU or accelerator offload

These constraints simplify reasoning about performance and correctness.

---

## Design Philosophy

`rx888_dsp` is designed to behave like a classic Unix utility:
- Simple inputs and outputs
- Explicit failure modes
- Composable with other tools

Performance optimizations were pursued until the pipeline achieved stable
real-time operation with headroom. Further complexity is deferred until
driven by concrete requirements.
